                <p>Hallelujah Praise God! God is good all the time and all the time God is good ! My name is AnneKiruba,
                    I’m a wife, mother and I also pursue my calling doing my worship ministry and I’m a YouTuber. But
                    today I came here to share about HOW GOD’S INVISIBLE GRACE CARRIED ME THROUGH EVEN WHEN I DID’NT
                    KNOW! It is a testimony, a story that God wrote in my life but for His name to be glorified! It was the very first day of 2021, New Year day of 2021 - Me and my friends families were about to
                    gather for New year , for some worship and on the way to our friends house something happened in my
                    head my neck and spine area. Had excruciating pain in my head and experienced dizziness and
                    imbalance. So we got there to my friends house and I didn’t know what’s happening around me. I
                    didn’t know- I had slept for a while and had woken up ,lead worship, had 2 mouths of food and came
                    back home. Literally now I remember nothing. It was a sleepless night. The next day I wasn’t able to get up from my bed I threw up thrice and it scared me a bit and now
                    my husband insisted to take me to the emergency. In the ER they ran through several Scans like MRI and CT and after 4 hours the doc said , HEY ,
                    BRAIN IS BLEEDING, WHO’S THERE WITH YOU? WE’RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE MAIN HOSPITAL AND PUT YOUIN
                    THE ICU. OKAY! I became speechless and wondered if this is really happening to me and what wondered me the most
                    was that , IN 12 YEARS THIS SAME SYMPTOMS HAD HAPPENED TO ME 4 TIMES THAT TOO SO RIGOROUSLY AND THIS
                    IS THE 5TH TIME , 2008, 2010, 2015, 2020 and the last 2021. Every time I’ve been to the doc ,nobody
                    diagnosed it but this time. In the ICU they ran through several scans and angiogram , only to find out that it was due to a
                    condition called AVM - where the arteries and the veins they just tangle up together like a cluster
                    and when the blood vessel breaks out under pressure causing the hemorrhage.There were teams of doctors and PAs who visited me with confusion, thinking that how in the world
                    this woman is found w/o any disability like a heart stroke or paralytic attack or seizures. Until
                    the day I got discharged they couldn’t stop checking on me because everything looked normal. They gave a ‘ HIGH LEVEL RISK BAND’ for me . All I could see during the hospital days was a picture
                    of ME BEING carried by the mighty hands of JESUS AND THIS VERSE RESONATING IN MY SOUL FROM PSALM
                    136:1 that GOD IS GOOD AND HIS LOVE ENDURES FOREVER . They gave me 2 options- either I can go for a surgery or a stereotactic radio surgery. But if I go
                    for surgery , it’s 5 hours of duration, my skull will be opened and they’d work on the hemorrhaged
                    nerve to stop the blood flow, take me to the angiogram theater with the open skull to check if the
                    blood flow has really stopped bring me back to the surgery room and close the skull with sutures.
                    But YOU MIGHT LOOSE YOUR SPEECH… If you choose radiation, it’s 3 years of healing time with 100% bleeding. If I have ever
                    experienced FEAR AND CONFUSION TO THE FULLEST DEGREE IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE TIME, IT’S ONLY AT THIS
                    MOMENT! But Our God is a God of PEACE AND NOT CONFUSION, BUT SOMETIMES HE ALLOWS CONFUSIONS TO HAPPEN THAT
                    WE MIGHT COME TO HIM AGAIN FOR CLARIFICATION!True enough , after praying so many prayers and a little discussion with my family I was able to
                    take a decision on this and I decided to go for radiation. So the next virtual appointment day came and even before I would open my mouth to say yes for
                    radiation, the surgeon said hey we are going to try radiation on you because we had a couple of
                    different cases, where one woman just like the same brain condition as you came half inactive, like
                    a paralyzed. And they were forced to do the surgery on her.
                    Another young lady with the bigger AVM , had multiple seizures and they were forced to do the
                    surgery on her. Look , when I was confused w my situation, God was working with the doctors for clarification. Ask
                    me how, God made two Neurological conferences to happen where they decided to try the stereotactic
                    radiation on me! And even after the radiation, the expectancy was to loose few patches of hair . But I didn’t loose
                    one single hair than my usual hair droppings… This is our God , from my life’s first cry until this moment of my life He’s been ever
                    faithful….Even me w/o knowing what’s happening within me , God took care of. You do not know how
                    many accidents God has protected you from, you do not know how many troubles and diseases and
                    dangers He has protected you from!I’ve been saved since 23 years, but never even once He had let me down!</p>
